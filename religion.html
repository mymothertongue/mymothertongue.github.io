                <b>Mundart</b>: It's the Swiss word that defines the Swiss German dialects.

                <h2>Swiss Dialects</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    If you have reached this site after reading my previous entries, you would have realized 
                    that Swiss German people do not like the German language. They stick to their dialects,
                    and in the best case scenario, they will start in German and quickly switch to Swiss German.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    My personal experiences have led me to think that Swiss German dialects are commonly <b>used as 
                    political weapons rather than as communication tools</b>. There was even a 
                    <a href="https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/im-nationalrat-gilt-bei-debatten-weiterhin-mundart-verbot-142252455365"
                    target="_blank">vote</a> in 2023 in the Swiss parliament to allow Swiss German for debates. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The problem here is that there are 4 official languages and simultaneous translation.
                    So you need to find people to translate from all dialects to the other official languages, which is 
                    nearly impossible. Fortunately, the vote was denied, and (High) German applies. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    So you need to <b>enforce by law</b> the usage of the language, as expecting common sense is not 
                    possible here. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph"> This attitude reminds me a lot of the way nationalism and religion work. 
                    You just get either a <b>Mantra</b> or a <b>God</b> (or both), which you have to respect and follow without 
                    questioning if it makes sense or not, or even if it harms anyone.
