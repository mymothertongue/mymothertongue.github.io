                    whether they like it or not, they have to accept. Isn’t that the whole idea behind 
                    the "amazing" referendum system they’re so proud of?  Isn’t this exactly what the 
                    Swiss People’s Party claims when they win?: <b>The people have decided, and this law must be implemented</b>. 
                    So they say...

                    - I won’t disclose the most common answer, nor the expressions 
                    they make when this question touches on topics like immigration or foreigners.  😁
