                <p class="paragraph">  
                    - <b>Contractual Clarity</b>: Will it be clearly stated in the contract that <b>my working language</b> is (High) German, ensuring I will be exclusively involved in High German projects?
                </p> 
                <p class="paragraph">
                    - <b>Enforcement of Language Use</b>: What actions does your company take when an employee does not use (High) German as required, thus hindering others' work? Is there a protocol where these measures are clearly defined, such as immediate termination for discriminatory behavior?
                </p> 
                <p class="paragraph">
                    - <b>Compliance with Swiss Law</b>: Can your company guarantee compliance with the Swiss Constitution, especially <a href="https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/404/en#art_8" target="_blank">Article 8, paragraph 2</a>?

                <p class="paragraph">
                    - As a person who was not born here, whose mother tongue is not Swiss German, and who also does not understand enough Swiss German but holds Swiss citizenship, would you accept the following statement I often hear to avoid using (High) German with me in the office?
                    <ul style="text-align:left;">
                        <li>"I wonâ€™t use German because itâ€™s not my mother tongue."</li>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    - Is the above statement only valid for those born in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, or does it apply to everyone?
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    - Do you understand that every discriminatory situation will be reported directly to the police?

                    - What for do you require (High) German, if you won't use it?
