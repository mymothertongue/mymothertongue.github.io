                <p class="paragraph">
                    This is the official definition to be found in German in the Swiss
                    State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) at the time of writing (October 2024)

                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    <em>Mobbing is a form of <b>violation of personal integrity</b>. 
                    The Employment Act obliges employers to take the necessary measures to 
                    protect the personal integrity of employees.</em>
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    <em>Mobbing in working life (also known as <b>psychological terror</b>) 
                    refers to acts carried out by a person or a group against a specific 
                    person in a <b>systematic manner</b> with the aim of forcing them out of their employment.</em>

                <h2>Mobbing</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                   This is something that has happened to me several times over the past few years, 
                   and the origin of it all was a lack of proper understanding of Swiss German. 
                   Asking a "pure" Swiss citizen to speak (High) German is like asking a dictator 
                   to treat their people well. It’s just not doable.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Additionally, a company I worked for, which fortunately no longer exists,
                    <b>put my computer under surveillance</b> to find any reason to fire me. 
                    I even saw an email disappear right in front of me without touching anything. 
                    There are many tricks employers use to mob employees, and they ensure that 
                    you can’t prove these things are happening.
                 </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    So instead of being polite, well-educated, and respectful, what "pure" Swiss 
                    people do when you don't understand the dialects and ask for (High) German is
                    mob you to the point where you either leave or they fire you if you don’t quit on your own.


                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    If you have read my website before reading this, you will now understand that 
                    if you require in your contract that (High) German is the official language 
                    in the office "with me" (regardless of how others communicate with each other), 
                    they will never give you that guarantee, because <b>they can’t control their frustration 
                    with the language.</b>
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Only if this is enforced by law, like in governmental institutions, will they use it.
