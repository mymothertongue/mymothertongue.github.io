                <h2>Experiences with Governmental Institutions</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    If you’ve read the previous pages about my experiences with jobs 
                    and courses, you might wonder what the government will do. The answer? Nothing.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    I’ve shared this website with various governmental institutions to check their 
                    reaction. Personally, if I came across something like this, I would express support 
                    for the person affected and take action against the illegal practices described. 
                    I’d say something like, <b><em>"I’m sorry for what happened. We’ll do our best to prevent 
                    similar situations in the future."</em></b>

                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    But the actual response? Silence or pass the buck. The only ones who might take any action are the police, 
                    and that's only because they are obligated to enforce the law. The <b><em>"my mother tongue mentality"</em></b> 
                    is deeply ingrained in Swiss culture, and it's a difficult mindset to change.

                <h2>My favourite Institution</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In my main insights, I shared the following: <b><em>Swiss people will not consider 
                    you fully integrated unless you have pure Swiss blood. 
                    You will always be a foreigner even if you understand all dialecs fluently.</em></b>
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    I shared my concerns related to my job search with a governmental institution, who knew 
                    I hold a Swiss passport (<b><em>actually it is my only citizenship</em></b>). However,
                    their reaction was surpringsing. They recommended me to contact an immigration
                    office. WOW! So as Swiss citizen I need help from immigration offices? 
                    Hopp Schwiiz!! 😍
