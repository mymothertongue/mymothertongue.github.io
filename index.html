                            I had to interrupt 
                            meetings at work several times within an hour, 
                            as people switch to Swiss German all over again.
                            The message is clear: we don't care about you. 
                            It is better if you leave.
                        </li>

                            Some clients 
                            do not want me to get involved in projects,
                            as for them only Swiss German is an option.
                            Then, don't hire me. 
                        </li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            I hold a swiss passport, which means 
                            I fullfill all the requirements, which where voted on by the majority 
                            of the population in referendum, to be considered integrated in this 
                            country, and <b>I do not need to do more for that</b>. However, the integration topic come over and over again, 
                            as <b>Swiss People are never happy</b> with it. They like to vote, but not 
                            to accept the result. This is not democracy my friend.
                        </li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                            Swiss people will not consider you fully 
                            integrated unless you have pure Swiss blood. You will always be a 
                            foreigner even if you understand all dialecs fluently. Look what 
                            happens with 2nd and 3rd generation people.

                    <ul>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">I only use English with Swiss German people 
                            or in conversations where Swiss German people are involved as, even though it is not 
                            their modern tongue, it does not evoke any feelings of frustration (Swiss logic again).  
                        </li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Respect is above everything in my life. I never cared
                            about, skin color, sexual orientation, integration level, place of origin or language skills.
                            <b>So, you talk to me in a language I understand or you don't talk to me. Disrespect is 
                                not an option.</b> I can't help you with your ilogical frustrations, sorry. Go to a psychiatrist if required.
                        </li>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Xenophobia, racism, disrepect and discrimination can be treated through education, 
                            but unfortunately, the Swiss education system do not fight it properly as, even in kindergarden,
                            they prefer to make the people chose between German and Swiss German instead of promoting
                            bilingual education and love for both languages. When you are an adult it is too late.
                            <b>So, I report to the police that kind of behaviours.</b>
                        </li>
