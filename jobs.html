                <h2>Experiences with Job Applications</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In my search for job opportunities, which require German, 
                    I initially reach out with a table to find out the necessary 
                    <b>language requirements</b> in both German and Swiss German.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    While a few employers honestly state that they require a C1/C2 level 
                    in both languages, they also have the capability to use German as well. 
                    It comes down to their <b>willingness</b> to do so.

                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The majority of employers claim that Swiss German is not required. 
                    In response, I share my previous experiences and ask about how they 
                    address situations where coworkers do not care about others understanding the meetings
                    and their performace and job is put at risk.
                    I also ask whether they have policies against workplace <b>discrimination</b> 
                    and what measures they take.    
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    <b>The typical response?</b> They often revise their requirements to "Swiss German C1/C2 is required". 
                    This change on the requirements indicates a preference to <b>avoid responsibility</b> for ensuring 
                    effective communication in the workplace.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    What is funny is that some of that companies also require English. So the <b>Swiss Logic</b> here is:
                    <br>- I don't like German, because it is not my mother tongue. So I won't use it
                    <br>- But, I am perfectly fine using English, even though it is not my mother tongue
                </p>

                    A Swiss Governmental Authority
                    <br>- Aren‚Äôt they supposed to set an example in representing and applying <b>the law</b>?
                    <br>- The answer was: <b>"We can't give any guarantee in written form"</b>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    <br> - Is Switzerland truly as democratic as they claim to be, with their referendum system supposedly being superior to others? My answer: No.<br>
                    <br> - Do I speak German with Swiss German people? There‚Äôs no obligation to do so, right?
