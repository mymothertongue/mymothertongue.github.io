                <h2>Experiences with Freelance Registration</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Well here is the deal. I asked what the requirements are to register 
                    as a freelancer in Switzerland. Apparently, you need to start working 
                    as a freelancer, and they just need 3-5 contracts or bills to register 
                    you in the system. Are you ready for the mess they create?
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    I handed over 3 contracts and several bills from 3 different clients. 
                    The reply exceeded my expectations. They considered the contracts as 
                    if the clients were my employers, even though all were service/contractor 
                    contracts, and I invoiced on an hourly basis.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    So they wanted me to register as an employee, but all companies were outside 
                    Switzerland. Imagine asking someone in another country to fill in forms 
                    to register me as an employee. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ Of course, I didn't do it at all, 
                    and I submitted an objection. Now they need <b>3-4 months</b> to check 
                    everything, which at the time of writing would mean they'll decide at the 
                    beginning of 2025.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In the meantime I have provided 3 more contracts with several bills.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    But when did it all start? Well, I provided the contracts at the beginning 
                    of 2024. So like with the other experiences, wish me luck!
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    My personal opinion is that they don't want me to register, even though 
                    I fulfill all the requirements. Based on my experiences here, it's a 
                    decision not based on the actual criteria but on who I am as a person, 
                    just to make things more difficult.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    <b>Remember, I was not born here...</b>
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    However I expect a positive outcome as there is not even one reason to take another decission.
                    But governmental institutions are known to be very sorpresive and tricky.
